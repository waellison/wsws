# WSWS â€“ William's Simple Web Server

This is a small, stupid web server written in C, partly because I had nothing better to do and
partly because I wanted to better understand how Web servers work.

The socket code in socketfun.{c,h} is largely based on some socket code I first got from Dr. James
S. Plank at UT-Knoxville (I took several courses with Dr. Plank during my bachelor's in CS at that
institution) but I don't know if he wrote it or what, if any, the intended license was.  I am
assuming that it falls under some kind of fair use, but IANAL.  Dr. Plank's code has been cleaned up
and modernized since he wrote/obtained it in old-school K&R C (implying that this code goes back to
the late 1980s), and I may have to make some gentle modifications to this code so it will run
acceptably on macOS 13.1 "Ventura."

Choose freedom.  Do what the fuck you want to.
